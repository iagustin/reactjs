* Components: Reusable pieces of HTML, ie <MyComponent>
* JSX: Code using HTML like syntax you are already familiar with. 
* Props: Passing data around your application.
* State: How to maintain and change data
* Event handling: Interactivity with users.
* Lifecycle methods: Hook into different timing events of your react components.
* Forms: Help with good user experience
